        <h2>Learning</h2>
        <p>Despite being a BCA student, I didn't know much about GitHub even though it was a necessary tool which a developer needed. Even though many of my friends including me were complete beginners, our respected mentor Kushal Sir taught us from the very basics.</p>

        <h3>Day 1:</h3>
        <p>We learned how to install Git from the Git-SCM website. After that, we learned how to open Git, initialize a repository using <code>git init</code>, and saw some basic commands.</p>

        <h3>Day 2:</h3>
        <p>We continued with basic Git commands. Our mentor explained commands like <code>git status</code>, <code>git add</code>, and <code>git commit</code>. We also learned to view changes using <code>git diff</code>.</p>

        <h3>Day 3:</h3>
        <p>By the third day, we had practiced these commands so much that we could create files, add changes, commit, and view history confidently.</p>

        <h3>Day 4:</h3>
        <p>This day focused on branching and merging. We learned to create branches, switch between them, merge them, and handle branch conflicts.</p>

        <h3>Day 5:</h3>
        <p>We learned to sign in to GitHub and connect local repositories. We practiced <code>git push</code> and <code>git pull</code> to collaborate online.</p>

        <h3>Day 6:</h3>
        <p>The final day was exciting! We explored hosting a website using AI (ChatGPT), Git, GitHub, and Netlify, and deployed a simple personal website.</p>

        <h3>Remaining Confusions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Resolving merge conflicts</li>
            <li>Using .gitignore</li>
            <li>Reverting changes safely</li>
            <li>Writing clear commit messages</li>
            <li>Solving branch conflicts</li>
        </ul>
